/**
 * This interface is used to determine which method to invoke in a given class.
 * <p>
 * The method name and context are used to determine the method to be executed.
 * If there is only one method in the class, the method name can be omitted.
 * But the class should be a {@link FunctionalInterface}.
 * <p>
 * You can also specify a default method with the {@link DefaultMethod} annotation.
 * Only one method can be specified in a class.
 * <p>
 * {@link MethodQualifier} can be assigned to a method. It must have a unique value within the class.
 * If the method in which the Method Qualifier value is described cannot be found,
 * an {@link MethodNotFoundException} is thrown.
 * <p>
 * How it behaves when the value matching the parameter is not in the context depends on the implementation.
 * The method can be selected only when values matching all parameters are in the context,
 * and selection can be made even when only some of the matching parameters are matched.
 * You can make it more flexible by using {@link OptionalParam} annotation on parameters.
