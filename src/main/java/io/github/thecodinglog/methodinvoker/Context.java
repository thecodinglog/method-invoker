/**
 * The central interface provides objects for an application.
 * The context can be changed in running to get and run dynamically methods.
 * The context may have a hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * When a client requests an object, it looks for the requested object from the lowest layer to the higher layer.
 * If the requested object is not found in the current layer, it is looked up in the upper layer.
 * If an object is found in one hierarchy, additional objects are searched for in the same level.
 * Particularly when only one object is to be returned using a type,
 * only the first layer that is the object founded is the boundary for searching.
